# Mini Message Board

Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/mini-message-board).

## Functionality

This is the [Mini Message Board](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/mini-message-board) project, where I practice creating routes and views with a very simple message board.

## Thoughts

Fortunately the concepts here were all similar, after going through The Odin Project's Rails course. It's just a matter of learning a slightly different way of doing things here, with JavaScript, but it's all pretty clear and I enjoy it so far.

God bless.
